# LotusYoga

[View deployed site here](https://paola62010.github.io/lotusyoga/)

A website for a yoga studio located in Dublin, Ireland. The website includes a welcome page, a list of classes being offered, pricing for the classes, a gallery section, contact information and address, a map showing the studio location and a form to send a message to the yoga studio owner. 

The main goal of the website is to promote the yoga studio's services and lead new customers to make contact with the studio and potentially book a class. New customers should find all the necessary information on the website for them to make the decision to get in touch. 

## UX

## Features
---
Every page has the company logo and a responsive navigation bar. The footer on each page includes links to 4 social media platforms. 

#### Home page
 
The home page features a background image of a lotus flower to match the name of the company. The page is divided into two sections. The first section includes a welcome message for the visitor and a list of reasons to get in touch with the studio or join one of the classes. The aim of this section is to attract new customers and provide them with enough information to catch their attention in order to have them check the classes page and get more details on the classes offered. A call-to-action button has been added to encourage potential customers to check the available classes, by clicking on the link, the user will be taken to the classes page.
The second section of the page features a small form to allow the users to subscribe to the company’s newsletter for updates on events/promotions. 
 
#### Classes 

This second page is also divided into 2 main sections. The first section includes a list of the 5 classes offered by the studio. For each class there is a description of the yoga style that will be taught as well as the schedule (day and time). The second section of this page features 4 price boxes, showing the potential customer the different prices depending on the number of classes taken (1, 5, 20 classes or a private class). At the bottom of the page there is a call-to-action button that invites the user to contact the yoga studio, by clicking on the link, the user will be taken to the contact page. 

#### Gallery

The gallery page includes 12 pictures of current customers at the yoga studio. The aim of the page is to build customer’s trust by showing existing customers practicing yoga at the studio. The images are shown in a grid that resizes according to the different screens.
