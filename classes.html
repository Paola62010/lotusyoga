            <h3 class="yoga-styles">Vinyasa Yoga <span>Mondays 6:30 PM</span></h3>
            <p>This style of yoga is characterized by stringing postures together so that you move from one to another, seamlessly. The transition from one posture to the next coordinates with your breathing, it’s done specifically as you exhale or inhale and it gives you the feeling that your breath is moving your body. Vinyasa yoga is energising and often considered the most athletic yoga style, suited to those people who enjoy a more active pace.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 class="yoga-styles">Hatha Yoga<span>Wednesdays 7:00 PM</span></h3>
            <p>This style of yoga has a more relaxing, slower approach. You move your body slowly and deliberately into different poses that challenge your strength and flexibility, while at the same time focusing on relaxation and mindfulness. Hatha yoga places special emphasis on controlled breathing and posture. Building core strength, which is key to good posture, is another important aspect of this type of yoga. Hatha has hundreds of poses, including well-known ones such as Downward-Facing Dog and Standing Forward Bend. Poses are usually held for several breaths before you move onto the next.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="yoga-styles">Sivananda Yoga<span>Thursdays 6:30 PM</span></h3>
            <p>Sivananda Yoga combines aspects of both the Vinyasa and Hatha styles. As well as being an effective workout, Sivananda yoga is an amazing relaxation method, allowing your mind to release all mental tension an stress. Classes normally move at a slower pace and focus on meditation and cultivation of a peaceful mind. This style of yoga is based around 12 asanas (postures). The poses stimulate the cardiovascular system, increasing the breathing rate, messaging the digestive organs and stretching and strengthening muscles.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="yoga-styles">Yin Yoga<span>Fridays 6:30 PM</span></h3>
            <p>Yin yoga is focuses on passive, seated postures that target the connective tissues in the hips, pelvis and lower spine. It can work to improve your flexibility and range of motion and offers you peace and quiet that allow you to process your thoughts and emotions. Poses are held for anywhere between one and 10 minutes. It is a wonderful way to learn the basics of meditation.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 class="yoga-styles">Restorative Yoga<span>Saturdays 6:00 PM</span></h3>
            <p>This relaxing, gentle type of yoga is similar to the Yin yoga but with more emphasis on relaxation and less on flexibility. It includes guided meditation and it helps calm the body and clear the mind. Poses are often held for as long as 20 minutes with the help of props such as bolsters, pillows and straps to ensure maximum physical comfort. Restorative yoga is suited to anyone regardless of experience, age or physical condition.</p>
